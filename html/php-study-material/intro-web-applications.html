  <h2>Introduction to Web Applications</h2>
  <p>A web application (web app) is a software application that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are run locally on the operating system (OS) of the device. Web apps are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active network connection. These applications are programmed using a client–server model—the user ("client") is provided services through an off-site server that is hosted by a third-party.</p>
  <p>Web apps are becoming increasingly popular because they offer a number of advantages over traditional desktop applications. Some of the key benefits of web apps include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessibility: Web apps can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, regardless of the device or operating system.</li>
    <li>Scalability: Web apps can be easily scaled up or down to meet the needs of a growing or shrinking user base.</li>
    <li>Cost-effectiveness: Web apps are typically less expensive to develop and maintain than desktop applications.</li>
    <li>Security: Web apps can be more secure than desktop applications because they are hosted on remote servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Examples of web applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>E-commerce websites (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Walmart)</li>
    <li>Social networking websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)</li>
    <li>E-mail services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail)</li>
    <li>Search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo)</li>
    <li>Online banking services</li>
    <li>Online learning platforms</li>
    <li>Web-based games</li>
    <li>And many more!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How web applications work</h2>
  <p>Web applications are typically developed using a variety of technologies, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the markup language used to create the structure of a web page.</li>
    <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is the style sheet language used to control the appearance of a web page.</li>
    <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language used to add interactivity to web pages.</li>
    <li>Server-side scripting languages: Server-side scripting languages, such as PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails, are used to generate dynamic web pages, process forms, and interact with databases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When a user visits a web page, the following steps take place:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user's web browser sends a request to the web server for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files associated with the web page.</li>
    <li>The web server sends the requested files to the user's web browser.</li>
    <li>The user's web browser renders the web page by parsing the HTML and CSS files, and executing the JavaScript code.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the web page uses server-side scripting, the web server may also generate dynamic content, such as a list of products for an e-commerce website, or a personalized news feed for a social networking website.</p>

  <h2>Client-side scripting & Server-side scripting</h2>
  <p>Client-side scripting and server-side scripting are both important technologies for web development. Client-side scripting is used to add interactivity to web pages, while server-side scripting is used to generate dynamic web pages, process forms, and interact with databases.</p>
