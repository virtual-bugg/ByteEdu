    <h2>Control Structures in PHP</h2>

    <p>Control structures are essential components of any programming language, allowing for decision-making and repetitive execution of code blocks. PHP offers a variety of control structures that enable developers to control the flow of their programs.</p>

    <h2>Branching Statements</h2>

    <p>Branching statements allow for conditional execution of code blocks based on specific conditions.</p>

    <h3>if-else Statement</h3>

    <p>The if-else statement is the most fundamental branching structure, evaluating a condition and executing the corresponding code block.</p>

    <em>
    <pre>
        if (condition) {
            // Code to execute if condition is true
        } else {
            // Code to execute if condition is false
        }</pre>
    </em>

    <h3>Ternary Operator</h3>

    <p>The ternary operator provides a concise way to express simple conditional logic within a single line.</p>

    <em>
    <pre>
        $result = condition ? expression1 : expression2;</pre>
    </em>
    <h3>switch Statement</h3>

    <p>The switch statement handles multiple conditions by matching a variable's value to different cases.</p>

    <em>
    <pre>
        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                // Code to execute if expression equals value1
                break;
            case value2:
                // Code to execute if expression equals value2
                break;
            default:
                // Code to execute if no case matches
                break;
        }    </pre>
    </em>

    <h2>Looping Statements</h2>

    <p>Looping statements allow for repetitive execution of code blocks until a specified condition is met.</p>

    <h3>while Loop</h3>

    <p>The while loop executes a code block repeatedly as long as the specified condition remains true.</p>

   <em>
    <pre>
        while (condition) {
            // Code to execute repeatedly
        }    </pre>
   </em>
    <h3>do-while Loop</h3>

    <p>The do-while loop guarantees at least one execution of the code block, checking the condition after each iteration.</p>

    <em>
    <pre>
        do {
            // Code to execute repeatedly
        } while (condition);    </pre>
    </em>

    <h3>for Loop</h3>

    <p>The for loop provides a concise way to control the iteration count using an initialization, condition, and increment/decrement expression.</p>

   <em>
    <pre>
        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // Code to execute repeatedly
        }</pre>
   </em>

    <h2>File Inclusion Statements</h2>

    <p>File inclusion statements allow for incorporating external code files into a PHP script.</p>

    <h3>require Statement</h3>

    <p>The require statement includes a file, halting execution if the file is not found.</p>

    <em>
    <pre>
        require 'filename.php';</pre>
    </em>

    <h3>include Statement</h3>

    <p>The include statement includes a file, generating a warning but continuing execution if the file is not found.</p>

    <em>
    <pre>
        include 'filename.php';</pre>
    </em>
    <h2>Additional Control Structures</h2>

    <p>PHP offers additional control structures that enhance code organization and control flow.</p>

    <h3>foreach Loop
